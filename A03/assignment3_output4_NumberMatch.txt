Attempt 4 (Text from Google Gemini)

(The entire code thread is ran)

Enter the base number (n) for the AI model: 5
Enter the number of iterations (i) for the AI model: 4
Using n=5 and i=4 for AI model calculation.

AI Model

Let's carefully follow the pattern you've described:

- Start with n = 5.
- For each iteration, multiply the current value by itself (square it).

Here's the step-by-step:

1. Initial value: 5
2. After 1st iteration: 5 * 5 = 25
3. After 2nd iteration: 25 * 25 = 625
4. After 3rd iteration: 625 * 625 = 390625
5. After 4th iteration: 390625 * 390625 = 152587890625

So, after 4 iterations, the value is **152,587,890,625**.

Starting with base number (n): 5
Number of iterations (i): 4
----------------------------------------
Iteration 1: (5*5) = 25
Iteration 2: (25 * 25) = 625
Iteration 3: (625 * 625) = 390625
Iteration 4: (390625 * 390625) = 152587890625
----------------------------------------
Final result after 4 iterations: 152587890625
My calculations match the AI Model's result: 152587890625!
